CipherPad addresses several common annoyances and problems often encountered in note-taking apps:

- **Privacy and Security Concerns**: With end-to-end encryption, your data remains private and secure.
- **Lack of Intelligent Features**: The AI assistance provides smart features that enhance your note-taking processes.
- **Inflexible and Hard-to-Use Interfaces**: The application's interface is user-friendly and customizable, allowing for a smooth and personal user experience.

Here are some steps for a walkthrough of the application.

1. Creating a New Note:
To create a new note, click the "+ (plus)" icon in the sidebar. A modal will pop up asking for the title of the note and the folder where you want to save it. If the note does not belong to a specific folder, you can simply select "root". Click "Create Note" to finalize.

Use the search bar at the top of the sidebar to search your notes. The AI-powered search feature can find notes based on keywords in the title or the content, even suggesting results as you type.

1. Deleting a Note:
To delete a note, click on the trash icon located at the far right of the note title in the sidebar. Be careful, as deleted notes cannot be recovered.

Folders can be used to organize your notes. Click on the folder icon in the sidebar to view, create, or delete folders.
